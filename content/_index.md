## Welcome!

Hi there! I hope this website finds you well. As per previous posts (don't look for them, they don't exist), I'm writing to tell you how excited (maybe that's too strong an adjective?) I am to launch this page.

I created this to share some experiences with infrastructure as code, Azure, and experiment with Hugo, GitHub Pages, and programming in general. Don't take the things that I share here as the best ways of doing something. They are just the way that I found to solve the issue in front of me at that time.

Thanks for reading!
