## Welcome to my page!

Hi there! I hope this website finds you well. As per previous posts (don't look for them, they don't exist), I'm writing to tell you how excited (maybe that's a misuse of the adjective) to launch this one.

I created this page to share some experiences with infrastructure as code, Azure, and experiment with Hugo, GitHub Pages and GitHub as a whole.

Thanks for reading!
